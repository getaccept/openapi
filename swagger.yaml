        You must create a document to be able to send it to a recipient. When creating a document you can refer to previously uploaded files with file_id or you can choose to create a document and upload the files in on API post. You can only upload ONE file when including a file in the create document POST.

        Use either file_ids parameter to use existing uploaded file(s), file_content to send the document as base64 encoded string or do a multipart post with file parameter.

        All recipients must have either a valid e-mail or a mobile number.

        All events are recorded using requestor IP address. You can override this using header CLIENT_IP containing the end-users public IP address.

    description: 'To simplify the process of checking a documents status and make it more efficient in an integrated application, you can enable API Webhooks. Enable webhooks as a user with administrator privileges in the Settings | Integration | Webhooks. We support multiple webhooks for one application. Events will be POSTed to your webhook URLs and should be handled by you. A POST must be answered and your endpoint will need to return a 2xx HTTP. Otherwise, the callback will be considered a failure and will be retried later. Retries will be made after 1, 12, 24, and 48 hours. The sender (or notification_email) will receive an email notification after a failed attempt.'
